# My Learning Log Tracker
A repository that tracks my learning progress in Software Engineering.

# 📚 Learning Log

A public (or private) repository to track my daily learning progress as a software engineer.

The rule is simple:
> **If I learn something today, I commit it.**

This repo serves as:
- A personal learning journal
- A consistency tracker
- A long-term proof of growth

---

## 🧭 How This Repo Works

- **One commit = one learning session**
- Commit messages describe *what I learned*
- This README summarizes progress weekly
- Details live in commit history (single source of truth)

Example commit messages:
- `learn: react useState vs useReducer`
- `learn: python dataclasses and typing`
- `learn: postgres indexing basics`
- `learn: system design – rate limiting`

## 📝 Notes & Reflections

- Learning > consuming
- Confusion is a signal, not a failure
- Rebuilding without tutorials is mandatory
- Consistency beats intensity
- Don't rush out and patience is the key

## 📌 Rules I Follow

1. No zero-learning days (even 15 minutes counts)
2. Commit messages must be specific
3. Prefer depth over speed
4. Document *understanding*, not just completion

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Goal

Become a highly effective software engineer with:
- Strong fundamentals
- End-to-end ownership mindset
- Production-quality thinking
- Clear communication and documentation skills
